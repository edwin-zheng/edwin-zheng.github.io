<h3>Be Aware of Your Environment</h3>

Being familiar with any given environment is vital to producing quality work efficiently.  Throughout the entire ICS 314 semester at UH Manoa, one of the points that was emphasized is to get familiar with Intellij, an IDE. To simplify, students were told to get familiar with their coding tools and learn some of the shortcuts that come with it. While there are many shortcuts and features yet to be discovered within my experience with Intellij, this plethora of features I have already discovered help inspire deeper dives into other coding tools to see what they offer to developers. However, this inspiration is not limited to computer science fields. Any profession is bound to have tools at their disposal, and many tasks can become simple or less painful upon knowing techniques and uses of the available tools. Quality of life tools do not make a person good at their profession, but it can save people time which allows them to tackle other tasks much faster with all the time saved and make less mistakes. 

<h3>A Professional has Standards</h3>

Coding standards are key in keeping code neat and organized. The last thing a developer wants is having to read code written by several other people and have their formats be wildly different from each other. Functionally, the code accomplishes the task, but the way it was written can cause a headache for others, or allow others to clearly understand what was done. This concept can of course be extended to other fields of work. For example, a marketing team has four people who all market the same product their own way. Information about the product gets out there, but there is a high chance that there will be a conflict in information given. Perhaps one of the marketers is a little rowdy and leaves a bad impression to consumers which in turn hurts the company as a whole. Creating a guideline, or standard, of how one should present themselves and market a product clears up confusion and helps protect the reputation of the company and its employees. Imagine having a teacher that teaches the same topic in vastly different ways every day, this is bound to confuse people, while nothing new is being done. Having some plan of how things should be done helps organization of a team, or even a singular person. A cohesive plan is easier to execute than several ideas being thrown against a wall hoping that one will stick.
