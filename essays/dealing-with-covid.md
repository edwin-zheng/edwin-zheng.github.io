<h3>Back to the Daily Grind</h3>

<p>
  The Covid pandemic was certainly an unexpected surprise. I rather the virus not exist in the first place, but there is little point dwelling on this now. Surprisingly, my daily routine is not too different from what it used to be. Some of my classes do not hold any online lectures, but almost all of my classes had their own online components already, so the transition to online was rather seamless. I still have classes at roughly the same times and I still work at the same time. The only new obligation that I have taken on is to not go outside, which I already do well enough. However, there is something maddening about being confined at home. Normally, I am all for staying at home, but the thought of not being able to meet with friends or go outside for fun starts to dig into peopleâ€™s mentality.

<h3>Home School</h3>

<p>This whole Covid pandemic makes learning and working hard. There are some classes that are better in person, which makes learning their material suboptimal. While many parts of the University of Hawaii at Manoa have managed to successfully port themselves online, there will always be something missing. For example, when trying to help an ICS student with their homework. Being able to see the code of the student is extremely helpful, but doing this is not as clean as doing it in person. On top of all this, there is also the trap of being at home. Home may be the one of the easiest places to start slacking, especially if one is still dependent, so procrastination is even more present now. However, as time passes, this new online routine should be able to be adapted to, which should start to shrink these problems as people try to cope and survive through this pandemic.</p>
