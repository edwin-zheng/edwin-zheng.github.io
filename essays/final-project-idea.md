<h1>Project: Event Hub</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
  <i>The problem:</i> The University of Hawaii has many events going on, both from the students and administration. However, managing all the times for every event that a student or faculty is interested in could be a hassle, as one would have to go to each website to extract the info and place it into their own calendar. This is rather time consuming as all this information is scattered.
</p>

<p>
  <i>The solution:</i> Event Hub will be a place where all upcoming dates are stored for both official and unofficial events. Organizations can put their events on the calender for all students to see, and the students can then go into the app to see a full list of all events, or deadlines that will happen on that day. Now, students and faculty can now see all events localized into one place, instead of scouring different websites to find out what events are going on. 
</p>

<h3>Mockup page ideas</h3>

<p>
  Event Hub has three main roles that may expand later, a student role, an organization role, and an administrator role. Students will be able to browse through the calendar and filter out events based on various filters such as by organization or by official or unofficial events. Students can also make unofficial events, as long as they are not inappropriate. Organizations are capable of making official events and adding users to the organization, in which each organization is capable of assigning their own roles to users. Administrators will moderate the content to make sure events posted are not inappropriate. <br> <br>
  Some possible pages would be<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Landing Page</li>
    <li>Calendar Page</li>
    <li>Profile Page</li>
    <li>Organization Page</li>
    <li>Details Page (for event details)</li>
    <li>Administration Page</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Use Case Ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A student opens the app, logs in, sees the events, selects an events, flags an event, gets a notification as the event start time gets closer</li>
  <li>An organization opens the app, logs in, goes into the organization page, manages their organization, posts events to the calendar</li>
  <li>An administrator goes into the app, logs in, looks over all the events and verifies that the events listed are appropriate, if event is not appropriate the event can be removed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>

After implementing the base functionality, these are some features that could be added:
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to synchronize with Google Calender</li>
  <li>Allow users to add events to their own website and have it sync to the app</li>
  <li>Customizable UI</li>
</ul>
