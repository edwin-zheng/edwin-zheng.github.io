<h3>Overview</h3>

ManoaList is a web application designed to enable University of Hawaii students to sell their unwanted belongings easier. Allowing only University of Hawaii students to sign up and sign in, students and faculty can post their items to go on sale and be contacted by other users interested in their item. Administrators monitor the items being posted, create and delete categories that can be used to define items, and ban users who violate rules. Users can customize themselves through their profile page and leave ratings on items to let other users know how good or bad the seller was.

<h3>Contributions</h3>

For this project, I contributed to setting up the profile page and helped to fix some UI bugs that popped up here and there throughout the project. I also helped set up the Users API used to keep additional information about the user past their email and password. I helped touch up the visuals on the list of items page and implemented filters to sort the items. I also implemented image uploading into the website that allows users to upload multiple images for their items and allowed those images to be properly displayed when looking at that item's page. Outside of coding, the team gathered in meetings to review each other's code and to discuss any new issues or features that have come up or what should be implemented.

<h3>The Experience</h3>

From this project, I learned how to work in a different style in regards to working as a team. The communication between the team was close and the scheduled meetings helped keep things moving. This project has helped me learn more about Mongo and how to handle having so many people on a smaller project. In addition, I also learned more about React and the Semantic UI framework.
