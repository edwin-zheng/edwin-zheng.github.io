As a Data Entry Clerk for the Judiciary, my role was to ensure that the files scanned into their database were accurate. The environment was a quiet office with cubicles for each employee. This was a self directed environment where you find work to do instead of always recieving work from someone. I was given a supervisor that explained my job to me then I got to work. The information being looked at within this position was confidential.

This position taught me how to communicate effectively within an office environment, seperate work knowledge from my personal knowledge, and how to find more efficient ways to accomplish a task. I refined my techniques on asking concise questions or requests in situations where I need more information or work. Since all of the documents I worked with were confidential, I learned how to effectively keep what I knew from work seperate from my personal life, especially when it came to situations when I talked about this volunteer position. The task I was given was extremely repetetive, but this also gave me a chance to optimize how I verified the correctness of the document in the database, which I can use to optimize my approach to other problems quicker.
